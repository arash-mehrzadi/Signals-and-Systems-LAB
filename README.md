 ### In this repository, I prepared a training set to learn the basic concepts of signals and how to implement plots and functions.
 
 ### The syllabus is planned according to [Alan V. Oppenheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_V._Oppenheim)'s book (["Signals and systems"](https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-2nd-Alan-Oppenheim/dp/0138147574)) . you can find the topics according to the table in the " files " section and select the related notebook. 
 
 ### Note that the files are created according to the Alan V. Oppenheim's book and if you are beginner, you can train in order of the 'files' table.

# Files

 ### The files are available in [.ipynb](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbformat.html) format and you can easily view them in this repository . If you want to execute code, I suggest you use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). you can clone this project to your Colab and run codes and commit new changes.
